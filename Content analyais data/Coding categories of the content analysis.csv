Recognizing that specifications need improvement,Participants realized their problem specifications were not good enough and they should have improved them.,"""I did the wrong thing specifying variables with no correlation to objectives.""; ""I think I needed to work on adding more variables to get the optimization needed."""
Lack of understanding or familiarity with the task,Participants didn't understand the task or considered lacking experience in completing this task resulting in their poor performance.,"""This is the first time I am doing a task like this. I don't know if there was a better way to approach the task."""
Uncertainty about whether variables/objectives can be correctly analyzed by AI,-,"""I am not sure if those variables and measurement units were being used correctly by me or the AI during the task."""
Doubt about the clarity and effectiveness of specifications,"Participants doubted their specifications were effective, leading to poor optimization performance.","""I felt the variables and objectives themselves were decent choices. However, the issue was with setting the minimum and maximum limits as this resulted in many solutions that would be extremely unhealthy."""
Uncertainty about the correctness or impact of the approach,Participants expressed not knowing if they were performing tasks correctly or what impact their actions had on optimization.,"""I am unsure as to if I was doing it correctly."""
Limited knowledge about the problem theme (diet),They concluded little knowledge in diet as the reason for poor performance.,"""Because it is not a subject I know too much about."""
The problem specification restricted subsequent actions,"Set problem specifications limited their subsequent actions, thus affecting their sense of agency.","""Because the parameters were already set, which limited my creativity."""
Low agency because of AI,-,"""I felt that I could have been more involved if AI was not a factor. For example, you could have utilized AI in a different way."""
Doubt the effectiveness of solutions generated by the optimizer,Participants doubted whether the solutions generated by AI were effective or not.,"""The solutions produced were unrealistic and would have been extremely unhealthy."""
Uncertainty about the effectiveness of their manual optimization,Participants were uncertain about whether their manual optimization approaches were effective or not.,"""No way to tell if my answers were close to correct."""
Lack of explanation or feedback from AI,Participants didnâ€™t understand AI and needed more feedback from AI.,"""I couldn't understand what the AI was doing or receive any useful feedback on how it was making the solutions better."""
Specific design/mechanism of the service needs to be improved,Participants wanted to change the mechanism or design of the system.,"""I feel like I was not allowed to see all the choices at once and do my own comparison."""
The system is not transparent.,-,"""I wasn't certain that I was doing it correctly. It's not transparent enough."""
