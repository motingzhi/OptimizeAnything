## Introduction
"Optimise Anything!" is a web service that enables non-expert people to interactively utilize Bayesian optimization in the back end to solve optimization problems. 

## Access the service: http://optimizeanything.dice.aalto.fi/

The project builds on the previous work on MOBO by [L. Chan et. al](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3491102.3501850)<sup>1</sup>, [Y. -C. Liao et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=10024515)<sup>2</sup>, and [G. Mo](https://github.com/georgemo535/D3MOBO)<sup>3</sup>.

## How to install
Apache is used to run the program locally and so ensure you have [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/) installed first before use. To run the program: 
1. Download the files as a zip folder.
2. Copy the folder into `htdocs` within the `xampp` folder in your Local Disk.
3. Ensure the first line of the Python files in the `cgi` folder contains the file path to Python on your local system.
4. Click "Start" on the Apache module in the XAMPP Control Panel.
5. Copy the file path to the `welcome.php` page into a web browser using the following format: `http://localhost/Demo/welcome.php` where `Demo` is the filepath to `welcome.php` from the folder `htdocs`.
6. Follow the instructions and proceed with the application.


## Front-end
The PHP files represent the front-end of the program. The sequence of pages is:
1. `welcome.php`: Welcome page
2. `how-it-works.php`: Brief overview of how the AI-user guided optimisation works
3. `define.php`: Page to define design parameters and design objectives
4. `confirm-definitions.php`: Confirmation of design definitions
5. `existing-solutions.php`: Known bad solutions can be added here
6. `optimise.php`: Solutions proposed by AI and evaluated by the user
7. `results.php`: Summary of best solutions evaluated

`styles.css` is the stylesheet used as the foundation for the pages. `help.php` offers an explanation of the key stages to the program (defining design parameters and objectives, adding existing solutions, optimisation, and results), and can be accessed via those respective pages.

## Back-end
The `cgi` folder contains the Python scripts that form the back-end to the program. The purpose of each is listed below:
1. `log-definitions.py`: Saves and stores the design parameters and objectives to the SQL database `Data\database.db` after confirming the entries in `confirm-definitons.php`.
2. `import-all.py`: Contains all the relevant BoTorch modules and necessary parameters to be imported to perform the optimisation.
3. `initial-mobo.py`: The Python script where MOBO takes place. There are several functions that are implemented and executed depending on the user's choice: skip, give next solution or refine solution. 
4. `finish-solutions.py`: The script is used to determine the best solutions from those evaluated by optimising for each objective respectively. It also gives the best solution that balances both objectives.

The `cgi` Python module is used to store the necessary variables and information to transfer between the server and client sides of the program. 



## Miscellaneous
The `Archive` folder includes previous copies of files for testing and reference purposes. The `Pictures` folder includes the images used in the front-end in the program.
